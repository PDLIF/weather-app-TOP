# Weather App

## Project Overview

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to search for weather information by city name. It provides real-time data, such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more. This project was built as part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Node.js and JavaScript curriculum, aiming to develop hands-on experience with APIs, asynchronous programming, and front-end development.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Information**: Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather by entering a city name.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear messages for invalid inputs or errors when fetching data from the API.

## Learning Goals

- Understanding **asynchronous programming** using `fetch` and handling promises.
- **Working with APIs** to fetch and display real-time data.
- Implementing **error handling** for user inputs and API responses.
- Developing a functional, user-friendly front-end with JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To handle interactivity and API integration.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
